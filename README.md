# Projekt c# Image Maschine Learning with Webcam Images


This Projekt is made with  .Net Core and c# in Visual Studio.

I am a beginner in Programming with c# so this is a Test to try out Maschine Learning with Images (Finger Recognition) and i also tried to make
a Login Form with SQL. (I tried it for 5 days only to get the webcam in my Projekt :) )

Also i want to ask you guys what Projekt or Feature i can add to use a Arduino Mega to my Programm that i can Learn more.

I have no Idea because i dont want to make the "Easy" Project like a Calculator or something because i dont have Fun when 
i make these Projects. 

So if you have a Idea please hit me up. Also i would appreciate it if you find a problem in my Code so i can make it better.
